1. Requirements in README.

2. CONSISTENCY!

3. Webpack. Class components. Redux.

4. "add routing so that you can land on a recipe page or reload and have the same search". Could go one of 2 ways here. Chose/leaned towards one of them, simply because the word "routing" is used.

5. `@material-ui/core` is deprecated, so instead of using their components, just do the CSS myself.
